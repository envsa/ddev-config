# Each file should contain #ddev-generated so it can be replaced by a later `ddev get`
# if it hasn't been modified by the user.
# DDEV environment variables can be interpolated into these filenames
# If you use directories, they must be directories that are managed
# by this add-on, or removal could remove things that are not owned by it
